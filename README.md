## How to run

 1. Install React Native following [the official setup page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup);
 2. Make sure you already have [your Belvo credentials created](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/get-your-belvo-api-keys);
 3. Clone this repo;
 4. Run a `npm install` inside this folder;
 5. [Generate a Belvo access token for widget](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/widget-for-web#2-generate-an-access_token);
 6. Change the "`< INSERT-YOUR-TOKEN >`" on **config.js** file for your generated access token;
 7. Run `npx react-native start` (or `run-ios` or `run-android`);

## BelvoWidget component

<BelvoWidget
